The insert function is actually faster on the tiny and small arrays, but then scales much worse. With the extra large array, it takes more than 200x as long to run. As the size of the array grows by 10x with each array, the runtime scales differently, increasing slowly at first, then dramatically. 

Unshift is slower than push because it needs to shift every item in the array after it adds the new item. Push only needs to add the new item, wthout shifting any others.
